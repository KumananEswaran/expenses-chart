### EXPENSES CHART COMPONENT - FRONTEND MENTOR CHALLENGE

This project is an Expense Tracker Dashboard built with React, featuring a dynamic chart that visualizes spending over the past week and displays the user's balance.

## Technologies Used

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,react,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

## What I'm Most Proud Of:

1. Successfully Building My First React Project – Completing this challenge gave me hands-on experience with React and component-based architecture.
2. Integrating Chart.js – Visualizing data dynamically was a great learning experience, especially handling conditional styling based on the current day.

## What I’d Do Differently Next Time:

1. Improve Component Reusability – Breaking the UI into smaller, reusable components for better maintainability.
2. Add Context API – For managing global state instead of passing props down multiple levels.

## Challenges Encountered:

Challenges: 

Configuring Chart.js required setting up scales, tooltips, and dynamic colors for different days.

Overcome by:

 Reading the Chart.js documentation to understand scales, tooltips, and datasets.
